The Squirrel Census (https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/) focuses on the Eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis). Every year, they count squirrels and present their findings to the public. Here, data for each of the 3,023 sightings in the 2018 census is presented, including location coordinates, age, primary and secondary fur color, elevation, activities, communications, and interactions between squirrels and with humans.

Here, we aim to assess the eating and foraging habits of the city squirrels during day and night times, as well as the most common activities performed in NYC.
