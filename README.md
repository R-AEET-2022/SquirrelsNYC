The Squirrel Census (https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/) focuses on the Eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) sightings in NYC. In 2018, 3.023 sightings in the were recorded and presented to the public, including location coordinates, age, primary and secondary fur color, elevation, activities, communications, and interactions between squirrels and with humans.

Here, we aim to assess the eating and foraging habits of the city squirrels during day and night times, as well as the most common activities performed in NYC.
